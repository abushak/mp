Commerce Point of Sale (POS)
============================

## Setup

### UPC
If you wish to use UPC fields, 
you'll want to add the UPC field to your form config. 
It is added to the default product variation type by default 
but not displayed. If you wish to add it to any other product 
variations, just add it as you would any other field.

## Contributing
### Naming Conventions
Submodule names should be prefixed with "Commerce POS" to keep things
organized and tidy.
